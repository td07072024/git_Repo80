Etymology
The name "Jerusalem" is variously etymologized to mean "foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem";[42][43] the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.[44]

Shalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for "peace" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam).[45][46] The name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as "The City of Peace",[43][47] "Abode of Peace",[48][49] "Dwelling of Peace" ("founded in safety"),[50] or "Vision of Peace" in some Christian authors.[51]

The ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.
